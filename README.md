Project Introduction (What the application does, feature list) <br>
Our project idea was that historical pictures taken before color cameras were invented have grayscale image values. To help people investigate and analyze the information of the gray-scaled images more accurately, colorizing the pictures will be necessary and useful.
Our application implements colorizing gray-scaled photos and to detect object labels in the photos to be used to do a simple search using the label.
